# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

Adding JavaScript to an employee payroll tracking website in order to make it functional.

## Description

The Employee Payroll Tracker's JavaScript needed to be compeleted for functionality.
The following features needed to be functional:

- Store employee first and last name, and salary onto a table per user input.
- Those employees should display in abc order
- A calculated average salary should be viewable in the console.
- A randomly generated employee should be viewable in the console followed by some message.

## Completed Features

- All prompts for user input are functional
- While loop is functional, giving the user the option to add more employees, or stop. Clicking cancel ends the loop and generates the array.
- The array is viewable in the console.
-

## Challenges

- Even though my prompts and while loop are functional, the table does not display any employee information.

- I'm not sure why the following block of code did not work. I was unable to find a solution to the error stated in the console.

- I was unable to formulate any code for the randomly generated employee.

- This code was not touched by me, but errors in the console are present. I'm not sure if this error explains why the employee information did not store into the table.
